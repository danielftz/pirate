Features in the game so far: 
-A "combat room" where combat will take place where it's implemented. 
	-characters that can navigate and walk around the ship

-A "construct room" where ship can be constructed in that room
	-parts can be dragged into a grid and moved around

-each ship is currently consists of 
	lead_ship_part
	ship_part
	wall
	door

Features that I would like to be in the game in the near terms
-"Construct room" should be developed further. 
	-the size of walls should be changeable
	-every part should be able to rotate
	-each part should be deletable
	-the ability to save the design and copy it to the combat room

Created A Rudimentary ship construction mechanism
	-parts can now be rotated individually and in bulk if selected
	-parts are now deletable
	-instead of scalable wall, created wall block objected. Walls can be "painted" in blocks. 
STILL need to implement the algorithm to save the ship design and transport them to a differrent room. 
Ideas: set a ship block to command room, 
	save the position of other ship blocks and walls in that command room object
	the position are saved as distance relative to the command room block.

Also need some specific functions for each ship part (engine, gun, cargo, etc).

Further developing the construction mechanism
One ship design can now be saved and loaded! 

Next step of implementation:
	-load the ship design in room_construct_copy, where actual ship objects will be spawned instead of just previews
	-grid system within room_construct_copy, similary to combat room
	-the option to set the name of the ship design and load the design based on the name 
	(in effect, having multiple ship design saved)
