Features in the game so far: 
-A "combat room" where combat will take place where it's implemented. 
	-characters that can navigate and walk around the ship

-A "construct room" where ship can be constructed in that room
	-parts can be dragged into a grid and moved around

-each ship is currently consists of 
	lead_ship_part
	ship_part
	wall
	door

Features that I would like to be in the game in the near terms
-"Construct room" should be developed further. 
	-the size of walls should be changeable
	-every part should be able to rotate
	-each part should be deletable
	-the ability to save the design and copy it to the combat room
